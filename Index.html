        <p id="ps"><img src="f.gif"> Earth Day is celebrated on 22 April since 1970.  This international day reminds us about the interdependence between natural ecosystems and human life. It is a celebration of Earth’s biodiversity and a reminder that humanity’s future depends on how we care for our common planet. Earth Day brings us all together to think about our role in preserving nature and fighting climate change.

          With more and more events that show the dramatic consequences of climate change for life on Earth, there is a risk that people feel powerless to stop and reverse the deterioration of the environment. A wave of ‘climate fatalists’, those who believe we can do nothing to stop climate change, can have a major impact in discouraging action. However, a recent global survey conducted by research firm Ipsos shows that no more than 14 percent of people tend to be climate fatalists. On the other hand, the survey shows that a shocking number of them are young people. In fact, 22 percent of those aged 16 to 34 believe that it is now too late to slow climate change, including 39 percent of under-35s in India, 30 percent in Brazil, 27 percent in Spain and Sweden and 29 percent in the United States.<img src="f.gif"></p>

            Regularly cited as one of the most foundational works of the environmental movement, Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring reveals the extremely harmful human and environmental effects of chemical pesticide use, zeroing in on DDT. The success of her book prompted a campaign to ban DDT in the United States and was an impetus to the 1967 creation of the Environmental Defense Fund.

            In the introduction of Silent Spring, Carson’s biographer Linda Lear writes, “Carson’s writing initiated a transformation in the relationship between humans and the natural world and stirred an awakening of public environmental consciousness.” The book was named one of the 25 greatest science books of all time by Discover Magazine and has been designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society.
            
            Silent Spring is not only a must-have for your Earth Day books library but is also an essential work for understanding the historical trajectory of environmentalism.<br>

              Time’s 2019 Person of the Year and two-time nominee of the Nobel Peace Prize, 17-year-old Greta Thunberg offers a collection of her most influential speeches from across the globe in this #1 New York Times Bestseller. President Barack Obama called her “one of our planet’s greatest advocates,” and her rallying cry against climate change has inspired every generation to awaken to the issue.

Thunberg’s famous quotation, “I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear that I feel every day. And then I want you to act,” is characteristic of her “refreshingly—and necessarily—blunt” rhetoric (Kirkus Reviews). She is an impressive symbol for youth-led activism and continues to unnerve those who have ignored her previous calls to climate action.<br>

              In this seminal book, John Muir — considered the “Father of the National Parks” and a pioneering environmentalist, explorer, and founder of the Sierra Club — recounts his summer of 1869 shepherding in California’s Central Valley. It was Muir’s experiences connecting with Nature that inspired his lifelong love of the environment and desire to protect the natural beauty of our planet.

This edition of My First Summer in the Sierra, with 30 illustrations, serves as a stunningly beautiful introduction to Muir’s vast collection of works.

Marion Randall Parsons, an organizer of the John Muir exhibit at the Sierra Club, writes about Muir’s writing: “The beauty and freshness of the mountains are wonderfully reflected in this book, which seems to hold within its pages all the brightness and sunny geniality of a Sierra morning warming towards noon.”

My First Summer in the Sierra is a poetic love letter to the beauty of 19th-century nature, written by a legendary naturalist at the outset of his career.<br>

              In One Earth, author and biologist Anuradha Rao takes a trip around the world to interview and research individuals of all different ethnicities. Rao highlights the profiles of People of Color activists to demonstrate the significance of the intersection between culture and the environment.

Kirkus Reviews calls One Earth a “thought-provoking reading for young people figuring out their own contributions. This valuable compilation shows that Earth’s salvation lies in the diversity of its people.” Rao takes readers on a life-affirming journey and introduces us to an array of wildly creative people of all ages. The stories are accompanied by photographs, illustrations, and fun facts. One Earth is a testament to the innovation and power of people to effect transformative change.<br>

<h5 class="text-capitalize , f">US Senator Gaylord Nelson founded Earth Day after witnessing a massive oil spill that leaked millions of gallons of oil off the coast of Santa Barbara in 1969.<br><br>

  The first Earth Day was celebrated on April 22, 1970. Sen. Nelson chose this day because it fell between most students’ spring break and final exams, and he wanted to encourage young people specifically to participate.<br><br>
  
  The very first Earth Day sparked an environmental movement and led to the creation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) later that year.<br><br>
  
  Earth Day was also influential in passing environmental legislation like the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, National Environmental Education Act, and more.<br><br>
  
  On the very first Earth Day, more than 2,000 colleges and universities, 10,000 public schools, and 20 million citizens participated -- which was about 10% of the US population at the time.<br><br>
  
  Earth Day originated in the US but became recognized worldwide by 1990.<br><br>
  
  In 2009, the UN designated April 22 as International Mother Earth Day.<br><br>
  
  It’s estimated that over a billion people participate in Earth Day every year, making it the largest secular observance in the world.<br><br>
  
  Over 95% of primary and secondary schools in the US and millions of schools globally observe Earth Day each year.<br><br>
  
  On Earth Day 2012, more than 100,000 people rode bikes in China to reduce CO2 emissions and save fuel.<br><br>
  
  On Earth Day 2020, 20 million people worldwide tuned into the 12-hour Earth Day Live event, hosted remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic</h5>
